Built on top of the Tamriel Rebuilt gridmap - https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46821?tab=description and https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/galleries/maps
Many people have worked to produce those beautiful maps; see the file credits section on their nexusmods page for a list of some of these individuals.

In addition the maps use the wonderful freely available brushes of https://kmalexander.com/free-stuff/fantasy-map-brushes/
